# Nicks-World
This is a GitHub repository created for the purpose of a university class.

This repository will be used to post interesting coding projects done outside of my undergraduate study.
This repository is meant to be encourage exploration of coding and its principles outside of work/school.
I make this and have fun with it, all projects here can be used openly and publicly.

Thanks,
N
